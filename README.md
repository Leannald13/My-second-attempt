# My Second Attempt At My First Web Page

This module so far has covered HTML, CSS and the basics of Git and Github. 

## What have I learned

I have learned how to add links and images to create logos on the website. I am however stuck as to how I get the logos to look in line with each other as they curently look messy on the page.
I learned how to change font types and sizes.

### Git and Github

I have found this very difficult and have gone over this part of the module twice and feel I have started to get my head around it. I have learned how to create new files.
I have also learned how to add those files to the staging area and then commit them.
I have learned how to take the commited files and move them to github, and how to also make them a live link which I will need to use for my projects later on.
